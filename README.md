## Problem Statement
#### Through the course of building this application, we attempt to eliminate the challenges associated with the manual records and handling of license and insurance expiry of the drivers and the vehicles respectively. The drivers/owners of the vehicle will be alerted prior to the expiration date.

## Solution:
#### To present a working model of our project, we generated thousands of random( but valid ) vehicle number plates and license and insurance booking dates. This data will be stored in a json file as a python dictionary format. We extract this data from the dictionary, check the validity of the insurance associated with the respective number plates and alert the owners. Apart from that we also provide the user with the statistics.

## Technical Stack Description
### Tech stack used: Python(data analytics)
### Workflow :    
#### 1. Random and valid data generation.
#### 2. Storing and retrieval of data from the json file.
#### 3. Updation of expiration of license and insurance details. 
#### 4. Analysis of the updated data.
#### 5. Alerting the driver/ owner of the vehicle.
